# What about Kotlin

created by JetBrains and is opensource 

- Inspired by (but not limited to) Java, Scala, C# and Groovy
- One of the main ideas behind Kotlin is being pragmatic
- multiplatform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language
- compilation to the following platforms:
  - JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
  - JS (JavaScript)
  - Native (native binaries for various architectures)

Preferred programing language for Android by Google

Null safe

Static type system with elements of gradual and flow typing

Object-oriented language which also has a lot of functional programming
